# GitHub Pages Contact Form Solution

Since GitHub Pages only serves static files and can't run a Node.js server, we need an alternative solution for the contact form.

## Option 1: Formspree (Recommended)

Formspree is a service that handles form submissions for static sites.

### Setup:
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Get your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)

### Update the contact form:
Replace the current form submission with a simple HTML form that posts to Formspree.

## Option 2: Netlify Forms
If you deploy to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages, you get built-in form handling.

## Option 3: EmailJS
Use EmailJS to send emails directly from the browser.

## Current Status
Your site is currently broken on GitHub Pages because it's trying to make API calls to a server that doesn't exist in the static deployment.

## Quick Fix
I can implement a Formspree solution that will work immediately with your current GitHub Pages setup.
